# 🎛️ Hit Crate

**Hit Crate** is a macOS audio sample browser optimized for rapidly sorting through **one-shot samples** using intuitive controls like tonal balance sliders, LUFS-normalized playback, and similarity-based search.

Whether you're managing thousands of samples or just looking for the perfect kick, **Hit Crate helps you find the right sound faster than ever**.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🎚️ **LUFS-Normalized Playback**  
  Samples are automatically leveled based on LUFS readings, ensuring consistent loudness across your library.  
  Clip protection prevents output from exceeding **0 dBFS**, even at high normalization levels.

- 🌗 **Tonal Balance Slider: Dark ↔ Bright**  
  Sort search results by dominant frequency content. For example, searching for `"kick"` with the slider fully right shows your **brightest kicks** first.

- 🎯 **"Find Similar" Functionality**  
  Find sonically similar samples based on:
  - **Frequency content**
  - **Amplitude envelope**
  - **Transient structure**

  Additional toggle options:
  - **Frequency Filter (🎚️)**: Limits matches to those deeply related in spectral shape.
  - **Stereo Filter (🎧)**: Prioritizes stereo width similarity when enabled.

- ⭐ **Favorites Filter**  
  Quickly filter your search results to show **only your starred samples**, with all your current filters applied.
